# Study-and-Mitigation-of-Ransomware-Attacks-A-Virtualized-Environment-Approach
 The project incorporates the creation of ransomware, simulating an infection and encryption on a virtual machine, and implementing monitoring, detec- tion, and mitigation techniques. The intention was to better understand how ransomware can operate and assess defense mechanisms to protect critical systems.
